# Consumer Rebalancing Patterns - Real-World Use Cases

This document provides detailed information about the consumer rebalancing patterns and real-world use cases implemented in the Kafka Showcase project.

## Overview

Consumer rebalancing is a critical aspect of Kafka that occurs when the consumer group membership changes or partition assignment needs to be redistributed. Our implementation demonstrates real-world scenarios where rebalancing plays a crucial role in maintaining system reliability, performance, and compliance.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. E-Commerce Platform - Black Friday Scaling

**Scenario**: Global e-commerce platform experiencing 10x traffic spike during Black Friday sales

**Challenges**:
- Sudden increase in order volume requiring rapid consumer scaling
- Geographic load distribution for global customers
- Maintaining order processing guarantees during peak times
- Consumer failures during critical business periods

**Rebalancing Strategy**: Geographic Affinity Assignment
- Consumers are assigned to partitions based on geographic region
- Automatic scaling adds consumers in high-traffic regions
- Graceful handling of consumer failures with minimal disruption

**Implementation**: `EcommerceRebalanceListener`
```java
// Example consumer configuration for US region
"strategy=GEOGRAPHIC_AFFINITY;region=US"
```

**Key Features**:
- Dynamic consumer scaling during traffic spikes
- Region-specific partition assignment
- Graceful failure handling with automatic redistribution

### 2. Financial Trading System - Priority-Based Rebalancing

**Scenario**: High-frequency trading system with different priorities for market data

**Challenges**:
- Risk alerts require immediate processing by high-priority consumers
- Market hours vs after-hours capacity changes
- Critical trading events need guaranteed processing
- Regulatory compliance requiring audit trails

**Rebalancing Strategy**: Sticky Priority Assignment
- Critical consumers get priority for risk alert partitions
- Minimal partition movement to preserve in-memory state
- Priority escalation triggers immediate rebalancing

**Implementation**: `TradingRebalanceListener`
```java
// Critical consumer configuration
"strategy=STICKY_PRIORITY;priority=10;role=critical"

// Normal consumer configuration  
"strategy=STICKY_PRIORITY;priority=5;role=normal"
```

**Key Features**:
- Priority-based partition assignment
- Sticky assignment to minimize state loss
- Real-time priority escalation support

### 3. IoT Fleet Management - Zone-Aware Rebalancing

**Scenario**: Industrial IoT system with sensors across multiple availability zones

**Challenges**:
- Network partitions isolating entire zones
- Zone failures requiring immediate failover
- Critical sensor data requiring backup processing
- Latency-sensitive processing requirements

**Rebalancing Strategy**: Cross-Zone Resilient + Hot-Standby Assignment
- Primary and standby consumers in different zones
- Automatic failover when zones become unavailable
- Zone-aware distribution for fault tolerance

**Implementation**: `IoTRebalanceListener`
```java
// Primary consumer in zone-a
"strategy=CROSS_ZONE_RESILIENT;zone=zone-a;role=primary"

// Standby consumer in zone-b
"strategy=HOT_STANDBY;zone=zone-b;role=standby"
```

**Key Features**:
- Zone-aware partition distribution
- Hot-standby consumers for critical partitions
- Automatic failover on zone failures

### 4. Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform - Tenant Isolation

**Scenario**: SaaS platform serving multiple tenants with different SLA requirements

**Challenges**:
- Gold tier tenants requiring dedicated resources
- Tenant isolation for compliance and performance
- Dynamic resource allocation based on tenant growth
- SLA violations requiring immediate rebalancing

**Rebalancing Strategy**: Tenant-Aware + SLA-Based Assignment
- Dedicated consumers for high-tier tenants
- Shared consumers for lower-tier tenants
- SLA-based priority assignment

**Implementation**: `TenantRebalanceListener`
```java
// Gold tier dedicated consumer
"strategy=TENANT_AWARE;tenant=gold;sla.tier=GOLD"

// Silver tier shared consumer
"strategy=SLA_BASED;sla.tier=SILVER"
```

**Key Features**:
- Tenant-specific consumer isolation
- SLA-based resource allocation
- Dynamic tier changes with rebalancing

### 5. Streaming Analytics - ML Model Deployment

**Scenario**: Real-time analytics platform with varying computational requirements

**Challenges**:
- Different ML models requiring GPU vs CPU processing
- Model deployment changing resource requirements
- Real-time vs batch processing capacity allocation
- Resource optimization for cost efficiency

**Rebalancing Strategy**: Capacity-Aware Assignment
- Assignment based on consumer hardware capabilities
- Complex workloads routed to high-capacity consumers
- Resource utilization optimization

**Implementation**: `AnalyticsRebalanceListener`
```java
// High-capacity GPU consumer
"strategy=CAPACITY_AWARE;capacity=4.0;hardware=gpu"

// Medium-capacity CPU consumer
"strategy=CAPACITY_AWARE;capacity=2.0;hardware=cpu"
```

**Key Features**:
- Hardware-aware partition assignment
- Computational complexity consideration
- Dynamic resource reallocation

## Rebalancing Triggers

Our implementation detects and responds to various rebalancing triggers:

### Automatic Triggers
- **Consumer Join**: New consumers joining the group (scaling up)
- **Consumer Leave**: Consumers leaving or failing (scaling down)
- **Partition Added**: Topic partition increase
- **Zone Failure**: Availability zone becomes unavailable

### Manual Triggers
- **Priority Change**: Consumer priority modification
- **Capacity Change**: Consumer capacity updates
- **Tenant Migration**: Tenant moving between tiers
- **SLA Violation**: Service level breaches
- **Maintenance Window**: Planned maintenance requiring migration
- **Disaster Recovery**: Emergency failover scenarios

## Assignment Strategies

### 1. Geographic Affinity Assignment
- Assigns partitions to consumers in the same geographic region
- Reduces latency and ensures data residency compliance
- Handles regional failover scenarios

### 2. Load-Balanced Assignment
- Distributes processing load evenly across consumers
- Considers partition processing complexity
- Optimizes throughput and resource utilization

### 3. Sticky Priority Assignment
- Minimizes partition reassignment to preserve state
- Respects consumer priorities for critical processing
- Maintains previous assignments when possible

### 4. Capacity-Aware Assignment
- Assigns partitions based on consumer processing capacity
- Considers hardware differences (CPU, memory, GPU)
- Optimizes resource utilization

### 5. Cross-Zone Resilient Assignment
- Distributes partitions across availability zones
- Ensures fault tolerance against zone failures
- Maintains processing even during infrastructure issues

### 6. Hot-Standby Assignment
- Assigns each critical partition to both primary and standby consumers
- Enables zero-downtime failover
- Critical for high-availability requirements

### 7. Tenant-Aware Assignment
- Isolates tenant processing for compliance
- Dedicated resources for high-tier tenants
- Shared resources for lower-tier tenants

### 8. SLA-Based Assignment
- Prioritizes assignment based on service level agreements
- Gold/Silver/Bronze tier processing guarantees
- Automatic escalation for SLA violations
